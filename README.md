## SYSTEM CAPABILITIES

- Navigate through the ashes of your image collection
- Rotate forgotten memories
- Zoom into the details of what once was
- Find the location of files, if they still exist
- Terminal aesthetic for those who remember a world before the bombs fell

## MANUAL OVERRIDE CODES

```

ENTER: Browse what remains
R: Rotate (the world is never right anyway)
+/-: Zoom (closer to nothing)
L: Open Location (if it still exists)
F: Fullscreen (to hide from reality)
ESC: Exit (like everything else, this too shall end)
```
